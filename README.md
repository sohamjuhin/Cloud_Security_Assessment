# To run this script on Kali Linux, you need to have the boto3 library installed. You can install it using the following command:


pip install boto3



## Make sure you have AWS credentials properly configured on your Kali Linux environment (such as access key and secret access key) to authenticate with the AWS services.

## Save the script to a file, such as cloud_security_tool.py, and then run the script using the following command:



python3 cloud_security_tool.py



The script utilizes the boto3 library to interact with AWS services, specifically EC2 and RDS. It retrieves and displays security-related information such as EC2 security groups and RDS instance configurations. You can extend the script to include additional checks or security assessments for other cloud resources or services.

Remember to ensure that you have proper authorization and follow legal and ethical guidelines when assessing the security of cloud computing resources.
